As early as the period of Southwest Associated University, Mr. Pao-Lu Hsu, the pioneer of international mathematical statistics and the founder of probability and statistics in China, opened a course in mathematical statistics. In 1951, the first graduate student in mathematical statistics graduated from Peking University; in 1956, the first probability and statistics teaching and research room was established, cultivating eight specialized talents in probability and statistics, becoming the “seedbed of statistical science” in China. In 1985, the Probability and Statistics Department was established with Chen Jiading as the director; in 1991, the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics was established at Peking University; in 1995, the Probability and Statistics Department merged with the Mathematics Department to form the School of Mathematical Sciences. The Probability and Statistics Department has two teaching and research rooms: Probability Theory Teaching and Research Room and Statistics Teaching and Research Room. There are more than 20 teachers, including one academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, three national major talent plans, two national major talent plans (National Natural Science Foundation), and three national major young talent plans (National Natural Science Foundation). It has formed a teaching and research team with international first-class level, which can be divided into three main research fields: mathematical statistics and machine learning, probability theory, and biostatistics. The Probability and Statistics Department attaches great importance to student training. It is positioned to establish a complete talent training system to play a leading role in statistics and data science-related industries for the country. It cultivates high-quality talents with international vision, innovative spirit, and practical ability. After exploration and practice, it has gradually formed a training model of “one hand grasps classroom teaching to lay a solid disciplinary foundation; one hand grasps scientific research training to enhance scientific research innovation ability”, cultivating a group of high-level professional talents with solid theoretical foundation and independent scientific research ability. It has delivered a large number of outstanding talents in probability, statistics, and data science to domestic universities, scientific research institutions, and high-tech enterprises. Many young Peking University students are active at the forefront of international academia, leading the development of disciplines. After several generations of efforts by Peking University’s probability and statistics scholars, the Probability and Statistics Department has distinctive characteristics and advantages in talent training, scientific research, faculty team building, etc. The Probability and Statistics Department will continue to give full play to the traditional advantages of mathematical statistics, continuously strengthen cross-fusion with fields such as economics and finance, life sciences and medicine, atmospheric environment, etc., obtain more originality and pioneering achievements in fields such as probability theory and stochastic processes, complex data analysis such as high-dimensional function type causality inference modern machine learning genomics medical diagnosis etc., contribute its own strength to the construction of Peking University’s “first-class discipline” in statistics while making contributions to China’s national defense security people’s health economic social development. We warmly welcome colleagues who are interested in engaging in probability and statistical teaching research to join our Probability &amp; Statistics Department!"},{"title":"Faculty","date":"2023-09-10T16:08:08.153Z","updated":"2023-09-10T16:08:08.153Z","comments":true,"path":"people/faculty/index.html","permalink":"http://pkuprobability.github.io/people/faculty/index.html","excerpt":"","text":"Dayue ChenProfessordayue at math dot pku dot edu dot cn Jian DingProfessordingjian at math dot pku dot edu dot cn Hao GeProfessorhaoge at pku dot edu dot cn Daquan JiangAssociate Professorjiangdq at math dot pku dot edu dot cn Xinyi LiAssistant Professorxinyili at bicmr dot pku dot edu dot cn Yong LiuProfessorliuyong at math dot pku dot edu dot cn Yanxia RenProfessoryxren at math dot pku dot edu dot cn Xin SunAssistant Professor xinsun at bicmr dot pku dot edu dot cn&lt;/a&gt; Weijun XuAssistant Professor weijunxu at bicmr dot pku dot edu dot cn Fuxi ZhangAssociate Professorzhangfxi at math dot pku dot edu dot cn"},{"title":"PhD program","date":"2023-09-10T15:47:35.122Z","updated":"2023-09-10T15:47:35.122Z","comments":true,"path":"studies/phd/index.html","permalink":"http://pkuprobability.github.io/studies/phd/index.html","excerpt":"","text":"The admissions to the PhD program in mathematics is governed by the School of Mathematical Sciences and Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research. Each year, we take an average of 5—7 students into PhD study in probability. The duration of the program is usually 5-year long. Students take foundational courses in various areas of mathematics in their first year, and start dissertation after passing the qualifying exam. We offer a variety of graduate level courses in probability, including foundational courses in probability, stochastic processes, and stochastic analysis. There is also one topic course every semester offered by one of our faculty members, highlighting an active area of current research. The group has a friendly, collaborative and active atmosphere, as well as ideal student-faculty ratio.
